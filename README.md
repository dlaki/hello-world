# hello-world
My 1st repo

Dave here, I'm from the moon.
You ask what I like?
Well, i like programming but know a little about it.
I would like to explore the power of programming and how it will help and change our lives.
Forgot to mention, when I don't have anything to do, I'll go to my bed, get my laptop, open it for a while then nap, then eat, then nap then eat.
